## MatrixScape
#### MatrixScape is a simple and straightforward interpreted command language for calculating linear algebra problems

There are two versions of MatrixScape. One is written in [Java](https://github.com/JCurran0499/MatrixScape/tree/master/backend/Java/MatrixScape) and serves as an API. The other is in Python (coming soon) and will serve as a Lambda function behind an AWS API Gateway.

### Download and Installation

The download tools provided to you in this repository are based on the Linux OS distributions popular with basic AWS EC2 instances, specifically Red Hat, AWS Linux, CentOS, Fedora, and others. For other servers and virtual machines, the commands may be slightly different. <br/> <br/>
To check that your OS matches this distribution, run `yum --version` and verify that your OS recognizes the YUM package installer. <br/>
If not, then you must install Git and Java in a way that matches your OS. Once this is done, the project will run on your OS perfectly fine. 

### Frontend and Backend Servers

This project is designed to be run on two different servers, a frontend and backend. Below are instructions for setting up and running both of these servers. In many cases, especially your local device, it is acceptable to run both on the same host. However, it is best practice to set up independent public servers (ex: virtual machines) for this purpose. <br/> <br/>
The frontend will be accessed by users through the internet on HTTP port 80, and the backend will be accessed exclusively by the frontend on port 4567. Configure your Security Groups as such.
<br/>
<br/>
### Backend Setup
#### Download Git
```
sudo yum install git
git --version
```

#### Download Project Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/JCurran0499/MatrixScape.git
```

#### Give .sh Permissions and Install Java
```
cd MatrixScape
chmod u+x backend/start.sh
chmod u+x install_backend.sh
./install_backend.sh
```

#### Check Version
```
java --version
```

#### Run the Program
```
cd backend
./start.sh
```

From here, the MatrixScape API can be accessed on port 4567, at `<server_domain_or_ip>:4567`.

### Frontend Setup
#### Download Git
```
sudo yum install git
git --version
```

#### Download Project Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/JCurran0499/MatrixScape.git
```

#### Give .sh Permissions and Install Java
```
cd MatrixScape
chmod u+x install_frontend.sh
./install_frontend.sh
```

#### Check Versions
```
node --version
npm --version
```

#### Run the Program
```
cd frontend
npm start
```

From here, the MatrixScape UI can be accessed on your standard HTTP port, at `<server_domain_or_ip>`.
