### Introduction: What is MatrixScape?

MatrixScape is an interpreted command language that supports the calculation of linear algebra
problems. To use MatrixScape, run the [Program.py](https://github.com/JCurran0499/MatrixScape/blob/master/Python/Program.py) file and type in commands.
To exit MatrixScape, type **quit** or **exit** into the prompt.

The MatrixScape language allows the user to create variables and interact with them in a linear algebra context. This command language was originally
written in Java, but this new version is written entirely in Python. More features will continuously be added to the language, and this document
will be updated accordingly. 

The purpose of MatrixScape is to allow a simple and straightforward language for calculating problems using linear algebra concepts, such as 
matrices and vectors. This language is meant to make linear algebra problems easier to work with for those who do not have a 
background in linear algebra or machine learning. It is my sincere goal to make complex problems easier and more fun, and I hope MatrixScape
contributes to that effort.

### Data and Variables

There are 5 object data types used in MatrixScape
- **Number:** also referred to as a scalar, a number represents a simple real number value
- **Matrix:** the matrix is a mathematical two-dimensional organization of numbers. Matrices made of one column are *vectors*
- **Boolean:** the computer science representation of a true/false value
- **Tuple:** a collection of MatrixScape objects/variables in a given order
- **Range:** a discrete range of integers from a distinct startpoint and endpoint

The most efficient way to interact with these objects is to store them in *variables*.
```
>> x = 5;
>> y = 10;
>> (x + y) * 3
45
```
*Tip: ending a MatrixScape variable declaration with __;__ will not cause the result to be printed immediately, which is the default*

*Tip: comments in MatrixScape begin with __//__. Any text after that on a given line will be ignored*

Variables can be set to the 5 data types, and nothing else. Variables are dynamically typed and can be reset to any data type.
Variable names can only consist of letters, numbers, and underscores, and they cannot share names with any existing MatrixScape functions.
```
>> num = 0.5   // number
num = 0.5

>> mat = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]   // matrix
mat =
  [ 1  2  3 ]
  [ 4  5  6 ]
  
>> bool = true  // boolean
bool = true

>> tup = num, num+1, bool, mat   // tuple
tup = 0.5, 1.5, true, [ 1  2  3  ;  4  5  6 ]

>> ran = 1:6  // range (can only consist of integers)
ran = 1:6
```
*Tip: ranges must consist of integers, but they can include negative integers. If the first integer is greater than the second, the range will run in reverse order*

Any MatrixScape syntax errors will be caught and the given command will not run. The rest of the program will be unaffected.
```
>> x = 5;
>> y = true;
>> x + y
Error: invalid addition
```

### Matrix and Number Calculations

Matrices are created using the format **\[ row 1 values ; row 2 values ; ... ; row n values]**, with the values in each row separated by spaces. Matrices that do not 
have an equal number of values in each row will result in an error. *Matrices are mutable objects.*

Using a range in a matrix will add in all of the numbers within that range.
```
>> m1 = [5:8; 1 2 3 4]
m1 =
  [ 5  6  7  8 ]
  [ 1  2  3  4 ]
  
>> m2 = [7:(-2)]
m2 = 
  [ 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  -1  -2 ]
```
*Tip: you can use variables when creating a matrix*

*Tip: using parentheses in matrix brackets can be helpful. MatrixScape separates row values by spaces, but not within parentheses*

Using **:** will augment matrices
```
>> m1 = [1 2 ; 3 4];
>> m2 = [0 0 ; 3 4];
>> m3 = m1;
>> aug_m = m1:m2:m3
aug_m = 
  [ 1  2  0  0  1  2 ]
  [ 3  4  0  0  3  4 ]
```

Functions involving matrices are the core of MatrixScape. Simple mathematical operations (+, -, \*, /, ^) work between matrices and numbers.
```
>> m = [1 1 1 ; 4  5 7; 8 9 0];
>> m * 3
[  3   3   3 ]
[ 12  15  21 ]
[ 24  27   0 ]

>> m + [1 1 1; 2 2 2; 3 3 3]
[  2   2  2 ]
[  6   7  9 ]
[ 11  12  3 ]

>> -m
[ -1  -1  -1 ]
[ -4  -5  -7 ]
[ -8  -9   0 ]
```
*Tip: multiplying matrices will calculate the dot product*

MatrixScape mathematical calculations follow standard order of operations. Using parentheses will help remove any ambiguity. Addition (+), subtraction (-), 
multiplication (\*), division (/), exponents (^), and factorials (!) are all supported. Most of these expressions can be performed with matrices and numbers,
often together.

## Functions

There are several important functions used with MatrixScape objects.
- **row _matrix_**: returns the number of rows in the matrix
- **col _matrix_**: returns the number of columns in the matrix
- **size _matrix/tuple\range_**: returns the number of total elements in the matrix, tuple, or range
- **square? _matrix_**: returns the boolean of whether the matrix is square
- **invertible? _matrix_**: returns the boolean of whether the matrix is invertible
- **symmetrical? _matrix_**: returns the boolean of whether the matrix is symmetrical
- **inverse _matrix_**: returns the inverse of the matrix (error if not invertible)
- **transpose _matrix_**: returns the transpose of the matrix
- **rref _matrix_**: returns the *reduced row echelon form* of the matrix
- **det _matrix_**: returns the number of the determinant of the matrix
- **rank _matrix_**: returns the number of the rank of the matrix
- **identity _number_**: returns an *identity matrix* of the given dimensions
- **zero vector _number_**: returns a *zero vector* of the given length
- **type _object_**: prints the data type of the object (prints "void" if no type and "error" if error)
- **list**: lists all current variables, organized by data type
- **clear**: clears the screen of all visible commands (all variables will be saved)
- ***Boolean Functions***
  - **_boolean_ and _boolean_**: returns whether both booleans are *true*
  - **_boolean_ or _boolean_**: returns whether at least one of the booleans is *true*
  - **not _boolean_**: returns the opposite of the given boolean
  - **_object_ == _object_**: returns whether the objects are equal to each other 
  - **_object_ != _object_**: returns whether the objects are not equal to each other 
  - **_number_ < _number_**: returns whether a number is less than another
  - **_number_ > _number_**: returns whether a number is greater than another
  - **_number_ <= _number_**: returns whether a number is less than or equal to another
  - **_number_ >= _number_**: returns whether a number is greater than or equal to another
*Tip: any function that ends with __?__ will return a boolean*

Here are some examples
```
>> t = true;
>> f = false;
>> b = not (true and false)
b = true

>> identity 3
[ 1  0  0 ]
[ 0  1  0 ]
[ 0  0  1 ]

>> type b
boolean

>> type (x = 5)
void

>> m1 = [1 2 3 4 5; 6 7 8 9 0];
>> rref m1
[ 1  0  -1  -2  -7 ]
[ 0  1   2   3   6 ] 

>> invertible? m1
true

>> inverse m1
[ -2.66667   1.66667   1 ]
[  2.33333  -1.33333  -2 ]
[        0         0   1 ]

>> rank m1
2

>> [1 2 3] == [1   2  3]
true

>> [1 2 3] == [1 2 3 4]
false

>> ([1 2 3] == 5) or (5 < 6)
true
```

There are two functions related to matrices that have not been discussed yet. They are the **get** and **set** functions. They are more 
complex and will be discussed below.

### Matrix *Get* Function

It is also import to retrive values from matrices. This is done using the **get** command using the format
**get _row_:_column_ from _matrix_**. Indexing begins at 0.
```
>> m = [5 6 7 8; 9 0 0 -(5 + 6)]
m = 
  [ 5  6  7    8 ]
  [ 9  0  0  -11 ]
  
>> g = get 0:2 from m
g = 7

>> (get 1:3 from m) ^ (get 0:0 from m)
-161051
```
To get whole rows and columns, use the format **get row _n_ from _matrix_** or **get col _n_ from _matrix_**. Use a range instead of *n* to get multiple rows and columns.

Using the format **get _n_ from _tuple_** retrieves a value from a tuple.

### Matrix *Set* Function

It is important to be able to change values in a matrix. This is what the **set** function is for. This function follows the format
**set _row_:_column_ from _matrix_ to _number_**.
```
>> m = [0 0 0; 0 0 0];
>> m
[ 0  0  0 ]
[ 0  0  0 ]

>> set 0:0 from m to 5
m = 
  [ 5  0  0 ]
  [ 0  0  0 ]
```
You can also set an entire row or column of a matrix using **set row _number_ from _matrix_ to _matrix_** or **set col _number_ from _matrix_ to _matrix_**.

Setting a value in a matrix that does not exist within a variable will change the matrix, but this does not do much good since the matrix cannot be 
accessed again following that command. However, it can be helpful to change a matrix that exists in a tuple.
```
>> t = [1 2 3], [4 5 6; 7 8 9], 0;
>> set row 0 from (get 1 from t) to [0 0 0]
[ 0  0  0 ]
[ 7  8  9 ]

>> t
[ 1  2  3 ], [ 0  0  0  ;  7  8  9 ], 0
```

### Common Errors

##### Invalid Variable Name
```
>> 5&hello = 5
Error: invalid variable name
```

##### Invalid Matrix
```
>> [1 2 3 ; 4 5 6 ; 7 8]
Error: invalid matrix
```

##### Unbalanced Parentheses
```
>> (5 + 6 - (7 * 8)
Error: unbalanced parentheses or matrix blocks
```

##### Invalid Dimensions
```
>> set row 0 from [1 2 3] to [0 0]
Error: invalid dimensions
```

##### Invalid Math
```
>> 5 + [1]
Error: invalid addition

>> [1 2] * [3 4]
Error: invalid matrix

>> 5 ^ [6]
Error: invalid exponent
```

##### Decimals in Ranges
```
>> r = 5:6.5
Error: range must consist of integers
```

##### Invalid Comparisons
```
>> 1:6 < 5
Error: invalid comparison

>> // NOTE: == and != can compare different types, returning false
```

### Common Tricks

##### Negation
Negation is a powerful tool used with several data types.
```
>> m = [1 2 -3];
>> n = 6;
>> t = 1,2,3;
>> r = -1:6;
>>
>> -(m * 2)
[ -2  -4  6 ]

>> -n
-6

>> -t
3,2,1

>> -r
6:-1
```

##### Range Size
The absolute value of the difference between the beginning and end is the size of a range.
```
>> r = 1:6
r = 1:6

>> size r
5

>> r < 1:7
true
```

##### Set Several Rows or Columns
```
>> m = [1 2 3 ; 4 5 6 ; 7  8 9]
m = 
  [ 1  2  3 ]
  [ 4  5  6 ]
  [ 7  8  9 ]

>> set row 0:1 from m to [0 0 0 ; 0 0 0]
m = 
  [ 0  0  0 ]
  [ 0  0  0 ]
  [ 7  8  9 ]
  
>> set col 1:2 from m to [1 1 ; 1 1 ; 1 1]
m = 
  [ 0  1  1 ]
  [ 0  1  1 ]
  [ 7  1  1 ]
```

##### Verify Inverse
This trick is a fun way to interact with complex MatrixScape commands
```
>> m = [1 3 5 ; 1 1 2 ; 4 6 9]
m = 
  [ 1  3  5 ]
  [ 1  1  2 ]
  [ 4  6  9 ]
  
>> invertible? m
true

>> (get col 3:5 from (rref m:(identity 3))) == inverse m
true
```

### Conclusion

MatrixScape is a personal project of mine that I hope is found to be useful for anyone that needs it. This documentation contains most, 
but not all of the full functionality of this language. This project has become a continuous process, and more functionality will 
be added from time to time. If anybody has any ideas for features I could add to this source code, please feel free to reach out. I 
appreciate any and all suggestions. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work, and have fun!
